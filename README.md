Here is a clear and professional README for your Simple Image Slider (Carousel) project.

Simple Image Slider (Carousel) üñºÔ∏è
This project is a basic image carousel or slider built entirely with fundamental web technologies. It demonstrates the ability to manage image display and transition using JavaScript logic.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

HTML5: Used for the main structure, including the image placeholder and the navigation buttons.

CSS3: For basic styling of the layout, the image, and the buttons, ensuring a clean presentation.

Vanilla JavaScript: The core functionality relies on pure JavaScript for:

Array Management: Storing the image sources in an array.

State Management: Tracking the currentImageIndex to know which image is displayed.

Event Handling: Listening for clicks on the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updating the src attribute of the <img> tag to change the displayed image.

Looping Logic: Implementing conditional checks to ensure the slider loops continuously (e.g., clicking "Next" on the last image returns to the first).

‚ú® Key Features

Image Navigation: Buttons allow users to cycle through a predefined set of images.

Infinite Loop: The slider seamlessly loops from the last image back to the first, and from the first back to the last.

Dynamic Source Update: Shows competence in modifying HTML element attributes in real-time using JavaScript.
